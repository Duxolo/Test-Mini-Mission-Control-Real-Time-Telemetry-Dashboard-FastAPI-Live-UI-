This folder contains dashboard screenshots for the project.

They are included as a visual reference to quickly show:
- the overall UI layout and dark theme
- live telemetry cards, temperature gauge, real-time chart
- event log and fault injection controls (Inject Fault / Reset Fault)
- the rocket background styling

Note: these images are not required to run the project, they are only for documentation and preview.
