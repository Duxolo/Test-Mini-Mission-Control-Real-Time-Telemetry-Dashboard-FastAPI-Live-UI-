# Test-Mini-Mission-Control-Real-Time-Telemetry-Dashboard-FastAPI-Live-UI-
Built a mini “mission control” app: a Python simulator streams telemetry to a FastAPI backend, and a dark real-time dashboard displays live cards, a temperature gauge, charts, and an event log. Includes fault injection (OVERTEMP) + recovery and subtle rocket visuals tied to vibration.
